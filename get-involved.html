					<p>Laurel Advocacy and Referral Services, Inc. (LARS) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving homeless and low-income families and individuals in Laurel, Maryland, which includes parts of Howard County, Anne Arundel County, and Prince George’s County. LARS was founded in 1987 by local religious congregations, including churches and synagogues, for the purpose of assisting those experiencing homelessness and economic hardship. Although LARS does not proselytize or engage in religious activities, Laurel’s religious congregations remain key partners and vital sources of support for LARS.</p>
