<p>As you may have noticed on our social media and website, we are sporting a new logo! We hope you're as excited as we are to share in the good news.</p>
<p>We carefully selected elements that better demonstrated the good work we are able to perform with the Laurel community:</p>
<p>The lines: The new design sports strong, clean lines and presents a clean shape. This simplifies the logo and makes it more visually appealing.</p>
<p>The house: The house "A" represents the house-shaped agency building. LARS, inc. stands tall as a pillar in the Laurel community.</p>
<p>The handshake: The handshake inside the house completes the "A" and represents the agency’s partnership with the community, to work together &amp; empower clients.</p>
<p>The wordmark: The logo is formatted in a workmark, using the agency's name to build familiarity. The wordmark also utilizes the agency’s unique name in combination with the house and handshake to complete the image.</p>
<p>Color: The new logo demonstrates the use of two colors:</p>
<ul class="ul-standard">
	<li>Blue: The color of responsibility, security and stability.</li>
	<li>Orange The color of energy, enthusiasm and determination.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have feedback or would like to comment on our new logo, please feel free to send your input to our development team <a href="/learn-more.html#dev-contact">here</a>.</p>
