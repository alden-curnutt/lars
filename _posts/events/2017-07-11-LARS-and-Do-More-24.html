<p>We are incredibly grateful for the tremendous support we received during our Do More 24 campaign. Our goal had been to raise $5,000 and receive the match donation of $5,000.</p>

<p>Between online donations, anonymous donor match, the sunset prize, and offline donations (cash and checks presented to us at the Oliverâ€™s Tavern event), we raised right around $21,000!</p>

<p>Yes, you are reading that correctly- $21,000! In one day! It is only through the help and generosity of our supporters that we are able to continue our work.</p>

<p>Thank you to all who gave and supported our Do More 24 campaign! Through your donations we are able to provide services to the Laurel community.</p>
