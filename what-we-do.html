				<b>Emergency Services</b>
				<p>LARS offers a number of emergency services to Laurel residents three days a week, including: short-term financial assistance to prevent evictions and utility stoppage; assistance with security deposits and first month’s rent; vouchers for eyeglasses, hearing aids, clothing and furniture; referrals for shelter; and a food pantry which can be utilized by clients every 30 days. LARS has limited funds to assist homeless clients with obtaining ID cards and birth certificates, prescriptions and other minor health expenses, drug treatment, and mental health needs. A bilingual case manager is available to help facilitate services provided to the growing Hispanic population in Laurel. LARS also strives to make federal programs accessible to clients who lack transportation to larger social service hubs. Once a week, LARS hosts a representative from the Prince George’s County Department of Social Services who is available to assist clients with submitting applications for for SNAP (food stamps) and other federal benefit programs. LARS has partnered with many such organizations, including the Department of Veteran's Affairs, Amerigroup, and SafeLink to provide local access to needed services.</p>
				
				<b>Supportive Housing</b>
				<p>LARS also operates a Supportive Housing Program, which provides subsidized housing and long-term supportive services to 22 chronically homeless and disabled individuals and families who live in local apartments leased by LARS. Referrals for these programs come directly from Prince George's County's coordinated entry system.</p>
				
				<b>Self-Sufficiency Program</b>
				<p>LARS' recently piloted Self-Sufficiency Program provides more intensive case management/mentoring to 5-6 stabilized and motivated households who work closely with a LARS case manager to maintain permanent housing, improve financial habits, gain employment, and remove other barriers to self-sufficiency.</p>
