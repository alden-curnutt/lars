				<h3>LARS Holiday Program</h3>
				<p>This past holiday season, generous support from local families, community groups, and congregations allowed us to fulfill Christmas wish lists for <b>426 children</b> and distribute loose gifts to an additional <b>117 children</b>, along with holiday meals for each family. A huge thanks to all those who provided for these families and volunteered their time to help brighten their holidays!</p>
