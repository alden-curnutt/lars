				<p><em>- <b>A quick look back at 2016</b> -</em></p>
				<p>This past holiday season, LARS was able to provide gifts to about 330 children through the adopt-a-family program and an additional 102 children through loose gifts and gift cards donated by generous members of the Laurel community and beyond. Over 175 families and seniors were able to cook a holiday meal, thanks to donations of turkeys, hams, chickens, fresh produce, and other essentials to LARSâ€™ food pantry.</p>
