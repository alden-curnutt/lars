				<h3>{{ site.ui.new }} LARS School Supply Drive</h3>
				<p>Many LARS families are in need of school supplies as they prepare for the new school year. In order to better assist these families, we are preparing for LARS’ annual School Supply Drive.</p>
 				<p>During the 2016-2017 school year, LARS was able to assist over 150 students with school supplies and gave away 95 backpacks! With your help we will have the opportunity to assist many more families this school year.</p>

					<h3>Hosting a Drive</h3>
					<p>We hope you will consider hosting a drive to help us send Laurel children back to school with the supplies they need to succeed. <a class="link-blue" href="assets/documents/2017-07-20-School-Supply-Drive-Toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Download LARS’ School Supply Drive toolkit</a> for more information on how to host a drive and what school supply donations are needed.</p>
					<p>The toolkit includes:</p>
					<ul class="ul-standard">
						<li>Flyer with a List of Needed Items, to advertise your drive</li>
						<li>Flyer with a List of Needed Items, to provide LARS' information</li>
						<li>School Supply Drive Sign for collection boxes/bins</li>
						<li>Tips for a Successful Drive</li>
						<li>Info Sheet for Collecting and Delivering Items</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In order to ensure that students have the proper supplies prior to the start of the school year, we hope to begin distributing school supplies in early August.</p>
					<p>Donations can also be dropped off at LARS during business hours: <b>Mon, Wed, Fri 9am-2pm &amp; Monday 5pm-7:30pm</b>.</p>
