				<p>LARS hosts two 5K races each year: the Spring into Summer 5K in May and a larger Turkey Trot 5K on Thanksgiving Morning. This year, LARS is proud to host our 4th Annual Spring into Summer 5K and 1 Mile Walk! The race will take place at McCullough Field on May 5th, 2018 at 8AM and will follow <a href="assets/documents/SS16/2018-03-Laurel-Community-Day-5K-Course.pdf" class="link-blue" target="_blank">the same route</a> (can we highlight “the same route here” with the route link as well?) as LARS’ past 5Ks.
