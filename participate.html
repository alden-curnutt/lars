				<h3>Participate!</h3>
				<p>LARS hosts two 5K races each year: the Spring into Summer 5K in Spring and a larger Turky Trot 5K in November.</p>
				<p>For this Spring 2017 season, LARS was proud to partner with First Generation College Bound for a 5K to kick off Laurel High School’s Community Day. The 5K run and 1 mile walk will took place at McCullough Field, starting at 8AM and following the same route as LARS’ past 5Ks. We were excited to share this fun day with FGCB, a great local organization making college access and success a reality for low-income students in Laurel.</p>
				<p>13th Annual 5K Turkey Trot - Time / Date: <b>November 23, 2017 starting at 8AM</b></p>
