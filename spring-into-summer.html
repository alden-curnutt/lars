				<h3>{{ site.ui.new }} Laurel Community Day 5K</h3>
				<p><b>Save the Date:</b> Saturday, May 20, 2017 (Laurel, MD) @8am</p>
				<p>This year, LARS is proud to be partnering with <b>First Generation College Bound</b> for a 5K to kick off Laurel High School’s Community Day! The 5K run and 1 mile walk will take place at McCullough Field, starting at 8AM and following the same route as LARS’ past 5Ks.</p>
				<p>We are excited to be sharing this fun day with FGCB, a great local organization making college access and success a reality for low-income students in Laurel.</p>
				<p>All proceeds from this joint fundraiser will be split between LARS and FGCB to help advance our shared vision for the Laurel community. After the 5K, the fun continues just up the road at Laurel High School, including a car show, food trucks, a moon bounce, and more from 11-3PM.</p>
