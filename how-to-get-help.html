					<h3>LARS Services</h3>
					<p class="p-l-10">Services are provided to anyone who needs assistance in the Greater Laurel area regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability or unfavorable discharge from military service. The person requesting assistance must first come in to meet with a caseworker. No appointments are necessary. Please feel free to drop in during business hours (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00am - 2:00pm, and Monday evenings from 5:00-7:30pm), but please be sure to arrive AT LEAST 1 HOUR before closing to ensure that you are seen. A caseworker will conduct an "intake" session lasting approximately 30 minutes with the individual or family to determine how we can help.</p>

				<h3>Eligibility Guidelines</h3>
				<p>A LARS caseworker will assess the client's needs and, if necessary, refer the client to another agency for appropriate resources. The caseworker may also render a decision regarding the client's eligibility for financial assistance from LARS. Typically, clients must schedule a follow-up appointment with LARS in order to receive the financial assistance. Checks are always made out directly to the vendor (landlord, BGE, etc.). Checks are never made out directly to the client.</p>
				<p>Although we are not always able to assist our clients in the way that they would like, we do make all attempts to serve them to the best of our ability. At a minimum, we attempt to refer all clients that we are unable to assist ourselves to other agencies that may be able to help.</p>
