The person requesting assistance must first come in to meet with a caseworker. No appointments are necessary. Please feel free to drop in during business hours (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00am - 2:00pm, and Monday evenings from 5:00-7:30pm), but please be sure to arrive AT LEAST 1 HOUR before closing to ensure that you are seen.
