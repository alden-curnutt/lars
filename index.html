				<h3>How Do You Respond?</h3>
				<p>When someone on the street asks you for help, how do you respond?</p>
				<p>We all find ourselves confronted with these situations, and it can be uncomfortable because we don't know the right thing to do or say. Homelessness is easy to ignore as we go about our daily routines, but coming face to face with someone on the street is a gut-wrenching reminder that 29,670 people don't have a safe place to sleep at night, right here in our nation's wealthiest state.</p>
