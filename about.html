				<h3 class="h2">About LARS</h3>
				<p>Laurel Advocacy and Referral Services, Inc. (LARS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving homeless and low-income families and individuals in Laurel, Maryland. Our service area includes parts of Prince George's (zip codes 20707 and 20708), Howard (20723), and Anne Arundel (20724) Counties.</p>
				<p>LARS was founded in 1987 by a group of local congregation leaders and community members who sought a consolidated approach to responding to those who came to their doors for food and financial help. Today LARS is staffed by trained social workers and continues to receive financial and volunteer support from its founding faith-based partner organizations. LARS' mission is to enable homeless and low-income people in crisis to achieve stability and long-term self-sufficiency.</p>
