LARS was founded in 1987 by local religious congregations, including churches and synagogues, for the purpose of assisting those experiencing homelessness and economic hardship.

				<h3>How did LARS, Inc. Get Started?</h3>
				<p>In 1987, a group of local Laurel pastors and laypeople came together to develop a consolidated approach to addressing the number of people who were coming to their doors seeking assistance.</p>
				<p>Religious partner organizations help to support LARS financially and often provide volunteer assistance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselytism" target="_blank">Proselytizing</a> is not allowed, although helping clients develop their spiritual resources has been encouraged as part of a holistic approach of LARS' services.</p>

				<h3>How Is LARS Funded?</h3>
				<p>LARS' funding comes from a variety of sources, including federal, state, local, and private grants, support from partnering congregations, community members, and fundraising.</p>
				<p>Whatever it is that we do to help an individual or family in need, we do our best to convey that we are providing "crisis intervention." Our primary goal is to help families become more self-sufficient. We do not want to be a "band-aid" for crisis, but rather a bridge that helps families and individuals overcome barriers to self-sufficiency.</p>
				<a href="partners.html" class="cta">Community Partners</a>
				<p>Approximately 80% of funds come with significant restrictions, which generally do not include paying the staff. In 2010 LARS' administrative overhead was 12%, meaning that 88% of every donated dollar goes to client services.</p>
