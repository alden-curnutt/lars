					<h3>Our Community Support</h3>
					<p>Our community support is a big reason why we are so successful.</p>
					<p>LARS would not be able to help individuals and families in need without the generous support of its partners, which include its volunteers, individual donors, local businesses, local congregations, Laurel City, local counties, United Way, and foundations. We appreciate all donations and grants to LARS, whether big or small.</p>

							<h2>Quatrefoil Associates</h2>
							<hr class="brown">
							<p>Quatrefoil Associates designs and builds museum exhibits and has been doing so for over 20 years. The company moved to downtown Laurel in 1999. In September of 2010 Quatrefoil began a project for the United States Mint in Philadelphia to upgrade their visitor tour. Since the exhibit was all about coins, Bernhard Mueller-Anderson, Quatrefoil's Chief of Solutions, came up with the idea to combine the subject matter of the project with a collection for the community. He put up a 5 gallon carboy to collect change with the goal of donating the takings to a local charity at the successful conclusion of the project. The project opened to the public on July 3rd and Quatrefoil was happy to select LARS as the recipient of the collected coins, which totaled <b>$507.44!</b></p>
							<p>The funds were recently used to sponsor the Laurel Police Department's COPS Camp Help the Homeless Walk.</p>
							<p>Thanks Abbie, Bernhard, and Quatrefoil!</p>
