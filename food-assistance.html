				<h3>Food Pantry</h3>
				<p>LARS provides food to eligible clients once every 30 days. The majority of food in the pantry is donated by way of individuals, schools, congregations and community groups. LARS also receives state and county grants to purchase food, as well as food items from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p>
				<p>LARS makes every effort to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to clients as well. Volunteers pick up produce from the Capital Area Food Bank on a bi-monthly basis, bread and other baked goods donated weekly by local stores and frozen meals from Olive Garden. LARS also supplements the food pantry with SHARE good packages purchased with grant funds and donated by the Knights of Columbus.</p>
